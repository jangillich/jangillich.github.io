This mobile application was developed during a practical course at LMU Munich. It was designed for attendees of the MobileHCI conference in Munich 2013. Users are provided with several useful features like a restaurant and sightseeing guide, important phone numbers, a "How to behave in Germany"-codex, a dictionary with playable audiotracks and much more. Design and implementation of the app was done by three fellow students and me, support in the form of videos, pictures and sound came from a separate "Media Team".
